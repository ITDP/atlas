'<p>Car-free places provide a safe space for adults to stop and relax, which is especially important for those who are not able-bodied. They provide children with a comfortable and safe place to play as well as an outdoor refuge in <a href="https://pedestriansfirst.itdp.org/about">times of crisis</a>, like during the COVID-19 pandemic. </p>',
'<p>Car-free public places can be both an amenity and a piece of pedestrian transportation infrastructure because they provide safe walking routes to destinations which are often calmer and more direct.  </p>'
