Walking is ecologically friendly, emissions-free, free of charge, <a href="https://www.vtpi.org/walkability.pdf">economically productive</a>, and beneficial for both <a href="https://www.emerald.com/insight/content/doi/10.1108/S2044-994120170000009004/full/html">physical</a> and <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29858467/">mental health</a>. Both <a href="https://allpoetry.com/poem/14326800-Sweet-Was-The-Walk-by-William-Wordsworth">poets</a> and <a href="https://www.smithsonianmag.com/science-nature/becoming-human-the-evolution-of-walking-upright-13837658/">evolutionary biologists</a> agree that, in many ways, walking is what makes us human.  
</p>
<p>
In many cities, it is difficult to walk. This is often because destinations are too far away. If daily needs are more than a short distance away, people will often choose to use a motorized vehicle instead of walking. This indicator measures the number of people living within a short distance, 1km, of both some form of healthcare and some kind of school.
</p>
<p>
A high score on this indicator does not guarantee walkability. Even if destinations are within a walkable distance of residences, it is also necessary to make sure that infrastructure and urban design makes it possible, safe, and pleasant for people to walk. ITDP’s <a href="pedestriansfirst.itdp.org/">Pedestrians First</a> Neighborhood- and Street-level tools provide a more in-depth look at what matters for walking.

<div class = "title_indicator_label2">HOW IT'S CALCULATED</div>
<div class = "text_indicator2">
<p>
We use <a href="openstreetmap.org/">OpenStreetMap</a> data to identify the locations of primary and secondary schools as well as pharmacies, doctors’ offices, hospitals, and other (non-specialist) healthcare providers. We then count the people living within a 1km walking distance (along streets or paths) of at least one of each.
</p>
<p>
Ideally, we would also measure access to other services including fresh food, banking, post offices, and childcare; however, worldwide data quality is insufficient for those measurements to be useful.

<div class = "title_indicator_label2">Policy Recommendations</div>
<div class = "text_indicator2">
<ul>

<li><strong>Use zoning to permit mixed land uses</strong>, including basic services.

<li><strong>Adopt citywide goals</strong>, like 15-Minute Neighborhoods in <a href="https://www.citylab.com/environment/2020/02/paris-election-anne-hidalgo-city-planning-walks-stores-parks/606325/">Paris</a> or 20-Minute Neighborhoods in <a href="https://theconversation.com/people-love-the-idea-of-20-minute-neighbourhoods-so-why-isnt-it-top-of-the-agenda-131193">Singapore</a> and <a href="https://www.portlandonline.com/portlandplan/index.cfm?c=52256&a=288098">Portland</a>, that aim to provide daily amenities within a short walk of all residents.

<li><strong>Encourage or require <a href="https://itdpdotorg.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Densify_ITDP.pdf">high-density</a></strong> urban development so that more people can live within 1km of a service location. Density brings many <a href="https://www.itdp.org/multimedia/urban-city-density/">societal benefits</a>.

<li><strong>Co-locate social services and amenities of different kinds</strong> so that people can access healthcare, food, transit, and even post offices on the same trip, as described in pages 43 to 46 of the <a href="https://bernardvanleer.org/app/uploads/2019/06/BvLF-StarterKit-Update-Digital-Single-Pages.pdf">Urban95 Starter Kit</a>.

<li><strong>Encourage new uses of existing public spaces.</strong> Public parks can serve as locations for fresh food markets or pop-up child-oriented services, such as libraries or pediatricians on wheels. Transit terminals can host pharmacies.

<li><strong>Incentivize smaller but more frequent options</strong> like vegetable stands, kiosks, and mobile healthcare stations. These may be especially useful to caregivers and individuals with limited physical ability when placed along key routes and near transit stops and open spaces.
</ul>
