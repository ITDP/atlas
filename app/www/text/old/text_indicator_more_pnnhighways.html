<p>
Highways bring many forms of harm to people, and especially to people who live close to them:
</p>
<ul>

<li>Large numbers of polluting vehicles emit huge amounts of air pollution, and the areas within <a href="https://www.lung.org/clean-air/outdoors/who-is-at-risk/highways">500m</a> of a highway suffer the most harm. This pollution can cause asthma, cardiovascular disease, and death.

<li><a href="https://hms.harvard.edu/magazine/viral-world/effects-noise-health">Noise pollution</a> is the second-most harmful type of environmental pollution for human health. Consistent loud noise, as is found near highways, can cause or worsen  cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes, mental health issues, and low birth weight.

<li>Highways form barriers between neighborhoods, either preventing people from moving between them or forcing people to risk death on their daily errands. Road fatalities are the eighth-leading cause of death worldwide, and the only non-medical cause in the top ten.

<li>Highways also lead car traffic to increase in nearby neighborhoods as people drive to or from access ramps. This causes air pollution, noise pollution, and traffic violence throughout nearby neighborhoods.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
Although electric cars will lessen some of these problems, they still cause some <a href="https://www.greencarcongress.com/2020/03/20200308-emissionsanalytics.html">air pollution</a> and some noise - and they are no less dangerous on the road.
</p>
<p>
These problems are caused by all highways and arterial roads, but they are especially bad when they are caused by grade-separated limited-access highways. 
</p>





<div class = "title_indicator_label2">HOW IT'S CALCULATED</div>
<div class = "text_indicator2">
To identify grade-separated highways, we first identify all roads labeled in <a href="openstreetmap.org/">OpenStreetMap</a> as <em>primary</em>,<em> motorway</em>, or <em>trunk</em>. Then we find all parts of those highways with at least 1500m between four-way intersections, meaning those parts where traffic can flow freely and is not stopped by signals or crossings. After identifying these grade-separated roads, we count the number of people living at least 500m from the nearest one.

<div class = "title_indicator_label2">Policy Recommendations</div>
<div class = "text_indicator2">
<ul>

<li><strong>Immediately stop allocating money to highway construction</strong>. Once a highway is built, it is immediately harmful and difficult to remove.

<li><strong>Begin dismantling highways and replacing them with public transit, boulevards, and parks. </strong>This process has been successful in cities as diverse as <a href="https://www.cnu.org/what-we-do/build-great-places/cheonggye-freeway">Seoul</a>, <a href="https://www.cnu.org/highways-boulevards/model-cities/embarcadaro">San Francisco</a>, <a href="https://www.cnu.org/what-we-do/build-great-places/pompidou-expressway">Paris</a>, and <a href="https://www.cnu.org/highways-boulevards/model-cities/montreal-bonaventure-expressway">Montreal</a>. It has recently become a <a href="https://www.route-fifty.com/infrastructure/2021/11/highway-removal-funding-infrastructure-bill/186714/">national policy</a> priority in the United States.

<li><strong>Establish city-level or national-level transportation plans </strong>to not build, or to remove, urban highways.
</ul>
