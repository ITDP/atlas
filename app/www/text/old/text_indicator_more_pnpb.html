The majority of people are interested in bicycling more, but choose not to bicycle because they do not have safe infrastructure to get where they want to go. 
</p>
<p>
In cities that provide extensive, well-connected networks of physically-connected bicycle lanes, more people ride bicycles to get around. This benefits those people: it saves them time and money, while providing exercise to help them <a href="https://ehp.niehs.nih.gov/doi/full/10.1289/ehp.0901747">live more healthfully</a>. It also benefits society: it reduces air and noise pollution, saving <a href="https://www.heatwalkingcycling.org/">enormous amounts of money</a> in healthcare costs. Protected bicycle lanes also <a href="https://www.rff.org/publications/journal-articles/bicycle-infrastructure-and-traffic-congestion-evidence-from-dcs-capital-bikeshare/">reduce congestion</a>, <a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/3021074/making-the-economic-case-for-cycling-friendly-cities-with-bikeonomics">keep money</a> in the local economy, <a href="https://www.itdp.org/publication/protected-bicycle-lanes-protect-the-climate/">reduces carbon emissions</a>, and make neighborhoods more pleasant. The presence of protected bicycle lanes make streets safer, not only for cyclists, but also for <a href="https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2019/05/190529113036.htm">motorists and pedestrians</a>.

<div class = "title_indicator_label2">HOW IT'S CALCULATED</div>
<div class = "text_indicator2">
<p>
We use <a href="http://openstreetmap.org/">OpenStreetMap</a> data to identify physically-protected bicycle facilities (those tagged as <em>highway=cycleway</em> or <em>cycleway=track</em>) and count the people living within a 300m walk of these facilities.

<div class = "title_indicator_label2">Policy Recommendations</div>
<div class = "text_indicator2">
<ul>

<li><strong>Install protected bicycle lanes</strong> and/or add protection to existing lanes. Follow international <a href="https://globaldesigningcities.org/publication/global-street-design-guide/">quality standards</a>.

<li><strong>Set up “<a href="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/static.peopleforbikes.org/images/glp/PeopleForBikes-Quick-Builds-for-Better-Streets-Report.pdf">quick build</a>” or temporary cycle lanes</strong>, with the ability to transition them to permanent design.

<li><strong>Ensure bicycle lanes connect with greenways</strong>, low-speed low-volume streets, and cycle highways to form a network throughout the city.

<li><strong>Ensure lanes are well-lit, well-maintained</strong>, and reflect city conditions.

<li><strong>Redesign car-dominated streets </strong>as <a href="https://www.itdp.in/resource/complete-streets-framework-toolkit/">complete streets</a> that prioritize <a href="https://www.itdp.org/publication/africa-streets-walking-cycling/">safe cycling and walking</a>. 

<li><strong>Ensure that intersections are safe, </strong>including: Extending painted cycle lanes through intersections; Painting bicycle boxes in front of stopped traffic at intersections; Install bicycle traffic signals; Integrating fully protected intersection designs into plans for protected cycle lanes.
