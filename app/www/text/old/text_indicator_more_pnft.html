<div class = "title_indicator">People Near Frequent Transport</div>
<div class = "text_indicator">
When buses, trains, and other forms of public transit arrive every 10 minutes or less from 5 a.m. to 9 p.m., the service is reliable enough that people can confidently use it without planning their days around timetables.
</p>
<p>
Public transit is an extension of walking, and frequent transit is best. Reliable, regular public transit lets residents, including those with mobility impairments or young children, get to far-off destinations without a car. Accessible transit is especially important for low-income people, who are less likely to own cars and who might not be able to access necessary services without transit.
</p>
<p>
This indicator corresponds to the United Nations’ Sustainable Development Goal 11.2: <em>By 2030, provide access to safe, affordable, accessible and sustainable transport systems for all, improving road safety, notably by expanding public transport, with special attention to the needs of those in vulnerable situations, women, children, persons with disabilities and older persons.</em>

<div class = "title_indicator_label2">HOW IT'S CALCULATED</div>
<div class = "text_indicator2">
GTFS, or <a href="https://mobilitydata.org/data-standards/#what-is-gtfs">General Transit Feed Specification</a>, is the digital data format that represents transit maps and timetables. GTFS is usually published by transit agencies, although in some cases it is collected by advocates, researchers, or private firms. 
</p>
<p>
The organization Mobility Data maintains a <a href="database.mobilitydata.org/">database</a> of over 1800 GTFS files from around the world. We reference that database, downloading GTFS files from it, and use them to identify transit stops where vehicles come every 10 minutes or better, 5 a.m. to 9 p.m. 
</p>
<p>
If (part of) your city’s transport is not included here, there are two ways you can help us add it - and, simultaneously, you will probably help many transport riders in your city. 
</p>
<ol>

<li>If you already have GTFS data, you will have to <a href="https://database.mobilitydata.org/update-a-data-source">add it to Mobility Data’s database</a>.

<li>If you do not have GTFS data, you (or your city’s agency) will have to collect it, publish it, and add it to Mobility Data’s database. 
<ol>
 
<li>For more formal transport systems, which are documented and administered by a public agency, the data probably already exists. You can use software like IBI Arcadis’ <a href="https://www.ibigroup.com/ibi-products/transit-data-tools/">TRANSIT-data-tools</a> to convert it to GTFS and publish it before <a href="https://database.mobilitydata.org/update-a-data-source">adding it to Mobility Data’s database</a>. TRANSIT-data-tools is free for use by cities in low- and middle-income countries.
 
<li>For less formal transport systems, which are more often owner-operated or less regulated, you may have to lead an effort - or work with your local government - to collect the data in your city. You can develop your own approach, you can use open-source tools such as those provided by <a href="https://www.trufi-association.org/projects/trufi-in-your-city/">Trufi</a>, or you can hire a specialized consultant like <a href="https://www.trufi-association.org/#services">Trufi</a> or <a href="https://transportforcairo.com/">TransportForCairo</a>. If you hire a consultant, be sure to require that the data will be public and open.

<div class = "title_indicator_label2">Policy Recommendations</div>
<div class = "text_indicator2">
<ul>

<li><strong>Identify the most densely-populated areas without reliable, frequent public transport,</strong> and expand service to them first.

<li><strong>Plan for population growth</strong> in areas already served by frequent transport.

<li><strong>Increase funding for public transport</strong>, providing sufficient subsidies for operation, especially by shifting funding away from the construction<strong> </strong>of new roads.
</ul>
