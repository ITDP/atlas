<div class = "title_indicator">Population Density</div>
<div class = "text_indicator">Compact land use is the ultimate requirement for sustainability. In compact cities, the distances between places are shorter, so it is easier to walk or bicycle. Transit is more efficient because one station can serve more people. Sprawl is reduced, preserving farmland and natural surroundings. And even trips made by car are less environmentally destructive, because they are not as long.<br>
Itâ€™s important to note that density is necessary but not sufficient for sustainable transport. Compact cities also need to have the infrastructure, like bicycle lanes and public transit, that is measured in other indicators.

<div class = "title_indicator_label2">HOW IT'S CALCULATED</div>
<div class = "text_indicator2">Traditional population density statistics measure the total population divided by the total area of a city. To give a <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-10-26/the-deception-of-density" target="_blank">more meaningful measurement</a>, this indicator calculates the density of the neighborhood where the average resident lives. We use the grid cells of the <a href="http://ghsl.jrc.ec.europa.eu/" target="_blank">Global Human Settlement Layer</a> as both our input data and our analysis resolution.</div>

<div class = "title_indicator_label2">Policy Recommendations</div>
<div class = "text_indicator2">
<ul>

<li><strong>Update land-use regulations, zoning codes,</strong> and other rules to allow denser residential and commercial construction and to prevent low-density sprawl. Ensure that densification improves the pedestrian environment with an active ground floor. Reference the <a href="http://todstandard.org/">Transit-Oriented Development Standard</a>.

<li><strong>Incentivize development within the city</strong> instead of on the fringes. Apply development impact fees to low-density developments. Remove parking minimums and create parking maximums to allow developers to build space for people instead of cars.

<li><strong>Make space for people of all income levels</strong> by setting appropriate citywide policies to maintain and encourage housing affordability. Plan for densification in a way that avoids gentrification and displacement.

<li><strong>Prevent overcrowding while promoting densification.</strong> Ensure that all residents have the necessary living space, natural lighting, and ventilation.

<li><strong>Retract policies and projects that cause low-density sprawl,</strong> including expressways, flyovers, road widenings, fuel subsidies, and public investment in building or maintaining infrastructure on the urban fringes.

<li><strong>Dense neighborhoods should be designed with children in mind,</strong> as is described in <a href="https://www.citiesforplay.com/child-friendly-neighbourhoods">Designing Child-Friendly High-Density Neighborhoods</a><span style="text-decoration:underline;">.</span>
