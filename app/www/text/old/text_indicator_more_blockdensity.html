<a href="https://mirror.unhabitat.org/downloads/docs/StreetPatterns.pdf">Small blocks</a> make a neighborhood walkable. When pedestrians are forced to take detours around big buildings or large blocks, their walk <a href="https://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2017/01/why-city-blocks-work/">will take longer</a>, especially for people who tend to <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Gwj3NBSP6EDDvghp-ca_iote78nocrmILHATYvgPjMs/edit?ts=5f2c66aa#heading=h.aq95hxwjozct">move more slowly</a>, like older people, physically-impaired people, people with small children, or people carrying heavy objects. Smaller blocks mean that pedestrians can choose different routes to get to destinations, letting them combine trips more easily or choose the most pleasant route. 
</p>
<p>
Larger blocks, on the contrary, mean that the distances between intersections are larger and that cars will move faster. This does not necessarily mean that drivers will reach their destinations sooner - they may also spend more time waiting at intersections - but it does mean that pedestrians will be in greater danger of a fatal collision.
</p>
<p>
Small blocks can also be an economic benefit, because they create more corners where people’s paths cross and small shops can open. As Jane Jacobs wrote, “[l]ong blocks, in their nature, thwart the potential advantages that cities offer to incubation, experimentation. and many small or special enterprises.” (Jacobs 1961, p.183)

<p>
This indicator measures a fundamental characteristic of the city that is slow to change. That’s why it is especially important to take opportunities to plan small blocks in new neighborhoods and redevelopments.

<div class = "title_indicator_label2">HOW IT'S CALCULATED</div>
<div class = "text_indicator2">We use data from <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/14x2jyxCkCegXDPGxapVF1SB27phcJHnMEL2qdeP-hOI/edit#heading=h.z90ob9ofsoik">OpenStreetMap</a>, identifying the spaces between streets as city blocks, and counting the number of city blocks per square kilometer. OSM data may be incomplete, and our algorithm cannot always distinguish between actual blocks and some road medians or traffic circles that are shaped like blocks.
</div>

<div class = "title_indicator_label2">Policy Recommendations</div>
<div class = "text_indicator2">
<ul>

<li><strong>Set a citywide goal of having all blocks below a certain size</strong>. The size may vary between cities, but 12,000m<sup>2 </sup>(i.e., 110m x 110m) is a good threshold. Use that goal to guide planning, development, and redevelopment.

<li><strong><a href="https://ovacen.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/espacios-urbanos-y-paisajes.pdf">Plan for urban expansion</a></strong> by laying out a network of streets and walkways with small blocks ahead of time. Ensure that development is permitted to be dense enough to become a walkable neighborhood.

<li><strong>As neighborhoods redevelop, use a local planning process</strong> to find ways for small streets or pedestrian/bicycle paths to cut through existing blocks.

<li><strong>Look for existing small streets, alleys, and stairs</strong> that are already used as shortcuts by the community. Make sure they are clean, attractive, well lit, and safe so they become effective parts of the pedestrian network.
