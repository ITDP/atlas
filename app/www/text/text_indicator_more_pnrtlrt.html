<p>
Rapid public transport includes all forms of public transport that run at high speeds in their own separated tracks or ways â€“ heavy rail / metro trains, light rail, and bus rapid transit. Because rapid transport bypasses traffic congestion, it can be the fastest way to move around a city. Rapid transport can carry more people, farther and faster, than any other mode, and becomes increasingly necessary as a city grows.
</p>
<p>
However, rapid transport can never serve every neighborhood in a city, and so other modes - including frequent transport, walking, and bicycling - are necessary for shorter trips or trips in less dense areas.

<div class = "title_indicator_label2">HOW IT'S CALCULATED</div>
<div class = "text_indicator2">
<p>
We use data from the <a href="https://www.thetransportpolitic.com/transitexplorer/">Transit Explorer</a> to identify the locations of rapid transport stations, and use the street network from <a href="openstreetmap.org/">OpenStreetMap</a> to count the number of people living within a 1km walk of those stations. 
</p>
<p>
If you notice an error in the data representing your city, or if your city is not included in the Transit Explorer, please use the interface on <a href="https://www.thetransportpolitic.com/transitexplorer/#6/38.625/-78.673">that page</a> to submit a correction, or contact <a href="mailto:data@itdp.org">data@itdp.org</a>.

<div class = "title_indicator_label2">Policy Recommendations</div>
<div class = "text_indicator2">
<ul>

<li><strong>Extend existing rapid transit lines or build new ones in areas where the most people live</strong>. This will have a more impactful result than building lines in less densely-populated areas.

<li><strong>Build more <a href="https://tod.itdp.org/what-is-tod.html">housing near rapid transport</a> stations</strong>, to make more efficient use of existing infrastructure.

<li><strong>Develop long-term plans </strong>for rapid transport, which usually takes years to build.

<li><strong>Follow the <a href="https://www.itdp.org/library/standards-and-guides/the-bus-rapid-transit-standard/what-is-brt/">Bus Rapid Transit Standard</a> </strong>to build effective high-quality rapid transit for a much lower cost than metro rail.
