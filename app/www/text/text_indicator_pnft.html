If rapid transport is the skeleton of a cityâ€™s transportation network, frequent, reliable public transport is the circulatory system. It should connect every part of the city, even those where rapid transport cannot reach. We measure the number of people living within 500m of a stop where public transport comes at least every ten minutes.
