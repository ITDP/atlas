<p>
A car-free public place can be both an amenity and a piece of transportation infrastructure, creating a friendlier neighborhood for people who get around on foot or by bicycle. This indicator measures people who live within 100m of a car-free place, including parks, pedestrian streets, and plazas.
</p>
<p>
If a public place is car-free, even if it is small, it can be a safe and comfortable place for children to play and for adults to relax. These places are especially important for early-childhood development. <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Gwj3NBSP6EDDvghp-ca_iote78nocrmILHATYvgPjMs/edit?ts=5f2c66aa#heading=h.srp0dhib3t3m">Babies and toddlers</a> are at greater risk from traffic and from air pollution, and spaces to play are important for their brain development. They also provide an outdoor refuge in <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Gwj3NBSP6EDDvghp-ca_iote78nocrmILHATYvgPjMs/edit?ts=5f2c66aa#heading=h.l6wa94n03lqg">times of crisis</a>, including during the COVID-19 pandemic. Car-free places are considered pedestrian transportation infrastructure because they give people ways to safely walk to their destinations. Often, car-free alleyways and paths provide shortcuts, giving pedestrians a calmer, more direct route to their destination.

<div class = "title_indicator_label2">HOW IT'S CALCULATED</div>
<div class = "text_indicator2">
<p>
We use data from <a href="http://openstreetmap.org/">OpenStreetMap</a>, identifying all places marked as pathways, parks, plazas, or otherwise car-free areas. We then count the number of people living within 100m of these places.
</p>
<p>
Because OpenStreetMap data quality varies so dramatically, and correlates with income, it may appear that higher-income cities have a much higher score than low-income ones, even if the actual infrastructure on the ground is comparable.

<div class = "title_indicator_label2">Policy Recommendations</div>
<div class = "text_indicator2">
<ul>

<li><strong>Make space for people</strong> to relax and play by creating <a href="https://wriciudades.org/sites/default/files/pocket_parks.pdf">pocket parks</a> on vacant lots and converting street parking to ‘<a href="https://www.itdp.org/2014/05/09/reclaiming-the-city-one-space-at-a-time/">parklets</a>.” Open streets by converting them to <a href="https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2019/10/car-free-streets-benefits-around-the-world/">car-free areas</a>.

<li><strong>Encourage new uses of existing public spaces.</strong> Schoolyards can be opened to the public after hours when communities lack access to formal parks and playgrounds. In Copenhagen, schoolyards are unfenced and open to the public in the evening. 

<li><strong>Integrate spaces <a href="https://90ffb89e-d990-4f1a-90f3-7974ef8ea8c5.filesusr.com/ugd/534edb_67a4d41d9f9e4e5f80ef259bd60fd7d8.pdf">designed for play</a> into neighborhoods.</strong>

<li><strong>Follow the Social Life Project’s <a href="https://www.sociallifeproject.org/9-ways-to-reinvigorate-towns-cities-everywhere/">Nine Principles</a> for public spaces.</strong>

<li><strong>Embrace <a href="https://www.pps.org/article/lighter-quicker-cheaper">lighter, quicker, cheaper</a><span style="text-decoration:underline;">,</span> or <a href="https://www.itdp.org/event/power-of-tactical-urbanism/">tactical urbanism</a></strong> approaches to creating public spaces for people.

<li><strong>Find places where people already walk</strong> and turn them into pedestrian malls with access only to nonmotorized and public transport modes, as in <a href="https://en.mxcity.mx/2015/03/best-walking-streets/">Mexico City</a>’s many downtown pedestrian streets.

<li><strong>Follow <a href="https://publications.wri.org/citiessafer/#c5">Cities Safer By Design</a> guidelines</strong> for pedestrian streets and plazas.

<li><strong>Adopt a citywide plan</strong>, like Barcelona’s <a href="https://www.vox.com/energy-and-environment/2019/4/9/18300797/barcelona-spain-superblocks-urban-plan">superblocks</a>, that creates space in neighborhoods for people.
