Our indicators are designed to measure what matters for transportation in cities. In general, we measure the number of people who live near a certain kind of infrastructure, rather than the amount of that infrastructure. For example, 100km of bicycle lanes in a low-density semi-rural area might be less useful than 10km of bicycle lanes in the city center.
