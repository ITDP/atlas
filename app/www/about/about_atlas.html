The Atlas of Sustainable City Transport is an online data dashboard. It displays indicators of sustainable and inclusive urban passenger transport. The Atlas includes measurements of nine indicators for about 1,000 metropolitan areas. It also shares measurements for tens of thousands of legal jurisdictions and districts. These indicators don’t just measure infrastructure—they measure what infrastructure means for people. The Atlas is especially intended to be useful in low- and middle-income countries.

Policymakers at many levels of government who want to set goals for the expansion of sustainable infrastructure may take advantage of the up-to-date, easy-to-understand Atlas indicators. Advocates and journalists can use the Atlas to compare cities within a country, or even neighborhoods within a city. City planners can identify key areas for improvement, and interested citizens may find an opportunity to learn something about their home cities.

<p>We built the Atlas with open data, and we have published the data in the Atlas openly. This provides two advantages. First, in this database of about a thousand agglomerations, it was infeasible for us to validate every detail in every data source in every city. There are certainly inaccuracies in the data. If you find an inaccuracy as you use the Atlas, you can bring it to our attention or fix it yourself, and we will include your correction in our next data update. See the
  <em>Data &amp; Algorithms
  </em>tab for more guidance on how to correct the open data sources.</p>

Second, other people can use our data—and combine it with their own—to learn new things. For example, there is no global data source reliably describing relative income or wealth. This means we were not able to identify the correlation between public transport access and income worldwide. However, these datasets do exist for individual cities. An independent researcher could download our data showing the distribution of access to frequent public transport services in their city, then compare this data to a local map of income levels to understand how equitably the service is distributed.

<p>ITDP has drawn on four decades of experience in promoting sustainable, inclusive urban passenger transport in over a dozen countries across the Global South to produce this dashboard. The indicators build on a decade of work designing measurements that can inform policy, starting from simple non-geospatial calculations and continuing in this global geospatial dataset. These indicators were also informed by the wide list of contributors and reviewers listed in the
  <em>Authors</em>
  tab above.</p>
  <p>We are transport planners working on research and data. We hope that we have provided a tool to help practicing planners around the world.</p>
