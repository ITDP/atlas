Why do my city’s boundaries have a strange shape?
</p>
<ul>

<li>We don’t measure indicators based on the legal boundary of the city. Systems for legal boundaries can be very different in different countries, making it impossible to compare measurements. For an international standard, we use the boundaries of built-up <a href="https://ghsl.jrc.ec.europa.eu/ghs_stat_ucdb2015mt_r2019a.php">urban agglomerations</a> as measured by the European Commission.

<li>In many cities, you can use the ‘Level of Detail’ slider in the bottom right of the screen to find measurements for particular jurisdictions (legal boundaries) within the agglomeration.

</ul>
<p>
Why is data for my city missing or incorrect?
</p>
<ul>

<li>The Atlas draws data from a variety of open sources, as detailed in the ‘Data and Algorithms’ tab above. If you think that data for your city is missing or incorrect, the first thing to do is to check whether it’s correct in those sources, and, if not, fix it. For example, if a bicycle lane or a hospital is missing in <a href="openstreetmap.org/">OpenStreetMap</a>, you can easily <a href="https://learnosm.org/en/">correct it yourself</a>. If a rapid transit line is missing from the <a href="https://www.thetransportpolitic.com/transitexplorer/#5/28.729/-46.978">Transit Explorer</a> database, you can provide data to help add it. If frequent transit (bus) data is missing, you can make sure your city’s GTFS data is listed in the <a href="https://database.mobilitydata.org/">Mobility Database</a>. 

<li>Once you’ve made sure that the data in the open sources is correct, please contact <a href="mailto:data@itdp.org">data@itdp.org</a> to let us know that we should update our measurements for your city.

<li>If you believe there’s an error in our algorithms rather than in the source data, thank you for finding it! Please let us know at <a href="mailto:data@itdp.org">data@itdp.org</a> and we’ll do our best to fix it immediately.

</ul>

How exactly do you measure the indicators?
</p>
<ul>

<li>In the main map display, under ‘More Info’, you can read a short description of the algorithm for each indicator. If you still have questions, we welcome you to review the Python script used to calculate the <a href="https://github.com/ITDP/pedestriansfirst">indicators</a> or to contact us at <a href="mailto:data@itdp.org">data@itdp.org</a>.
