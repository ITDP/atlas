ITDP is dedicated to open-source data and algorithms. All of the code for the Atlas, <a href="https://github.com/ITDP/pedestriansfirst">backend</a> and <a href="https://github.com/ITDP/atlas">frontend</a>, is available on Github under the MIT open source license. All of the data that powers the calculations is available for at least free viewing, and most is also available under an open license.
</p>
<p>
The Atlas relies on four key sources of data:
</p>
<ol>

<li>We use the European Commission’s <em><a href="http://ghsl.jrc.ec.europa.eu/">Global Human Settlement Layer</a> (GHSL)</em> for the distribution of population and the boundaries of urban agglomerations. 
<ul>
 
<li>Specifically, for population distribution (<em>GHS-POP</em>), we use the 2022 release. For urban agglomerations (the <em>Urban Centre Database, GHS-UCDB</em>), we use the 2019 release. We intend to upgrade as soon as a newer version is available.
 
<li>The GHSL is available as <a href="https://ghsl.jrc.ec.europa.eu/faq.php">free and open</a> data under the <em><a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/">Creative Commons CC BY 4.0</a></em> license. 
</li> 
</ul>

<li>We use <em><a href="openstreetmap.org/">OpenStreetMap</a> (OSM)</em> for the locations of streets, roads, pedestrian ways, bicycle ways, social services (healthcare and education), and the boundaries and names of legal jurisdictions. 
<ul>
 
<li>OSM data is available under the <em><a href="https://wiki.osmfoundation.org/wiki/Licence">Open Database License</a></em>.
</li> 
</ul>

<li>We use Mobility Data’s <em><a href="https://database.mobilitydata.org/">Mobility Database</a></em> for data on the operations of transit systems. This data is encoded in the <em><a href="https://mobilitydata.org/data-standards/#what-is-gtfs">General Transit Feed Specification</a> (GTFS)</em> format, used by over 10,000 transit operators worldwide. 
<ul>
 
<li>The licenses of different GTFS files in the Mobility Database vary by operator.
</li> 
</ul>

<li>We use the <em><a href="https://www.thetransportpolitic.com/transitexplorer/#5/30.012/-46.538">Transit Explorer</a> </em>database, maintained by Yonah Freemark and Steven Vance, for the locations and classifications of bus rapid transit, light rail, and metro lines and stations.  
<ul>
 
<li>Transit Explorer data can be viewed for free online, or purchased for download and noncommercial use (USD $60 for the full dataset).
</li> 
</ul>
</li> 
</ol>
<p>
A great advantage of OSM, the Mobility Database, and the Transit Explorer is that anyone - from a government official to a concerned citizen - can edit them and correct inaccuracies.
