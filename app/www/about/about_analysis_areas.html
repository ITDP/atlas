<p>What are the boundaries of a city? The question has no single answer. Municipal boundaries are useful, but they are difficult to compare among countries. Urban agglomerations, defined based on standard metrics of urban population densities, permit comparison, but they are less useful for policymaking, since they do not correspond to legal jurisdictions. To avoid this difficulty, we have included several different areas of analysis in the Atlas of Sustainable Transport, letting users choose whichever best suits their needs.</p>

<p>In many cases, the administrative boundaries of a municipal jurisdiction do not align with the built environment of an urban region or with the way that region is experienced by residents or visitors. For example, the municipal limits of Boston contain less than 20% of the urban area’s population. City residents frequently pass between Boston and neighboring jurisdictions, like Cambridge and Brookline, without realizing they’ve crossed a city line—and in many cases, those neighboring jurisdictions hold important centers of business and population. When evaluating the city transport networks of Boston, it does not make sense to consider only the central municipality. Conversely, the municipal boundaries of Chongqing, China, include tens of thousands of square kilometers of surrounding countryside. This area is administratively governed by the municipality but is not part of the city in terms of urban transportation networks.</p>

<p>If you wish to compare Boston to Chongqing, you will need to overcome these jurisdictional distinctions. To do so, the Atlas uses definitions of
  <em>Urban Agglomeration</em>
  taken from the European Commission’s Global Human Settlement Layer and Urban Centre Database. This uses the

    <span style="color:rgb(17, 85, 204);">Degrees of Urbanization</span>
  </a>
  methodology, endorsed by the United Nations Statistical Commission, measuring contiguous population density around an urban core. When you view city-level information in the Atlas, the urban agglomeration is the first shape that you see. It does not represent the legal boundaries of the city, but rather the continuous built-up area. Because these agglomerations are based on the same methodology worldwide, you can use the Atlas to compare cities in different countries on the same terms.</p>
  
<p>If you wish to measure a city for municipal decision-making, however, the agglomeration may not be the appropriate analysis area. If the Boston Transportation Department were to set a goal of reaching 100% People Near Bikeways—providing easy access to safe cycleways for all residents—it would want to track that indicator only within the boundaries of Boston proper, since its department has no authority in neighboring jurisdictions like Cambridge or Brookline.</p>

<p>The Atlas also makes this possible. By using the “At the level of '' drop-down menu in the right-hand panel, the user can switch from viewing agglomeration-level data to viewing data at the level of municipalities and, depending on availability, sub-municipality jurisdictions, like districts or neighborhoods.&nbsp;</p>

<p>These definitions of jurisdiction-level analysis areas are taken from OpenStreetMap by identifying features with the
  <em>admin_level</em>
  tag. This tag represents areas that have some level of administrative authority. In OpenStreetMap, areas are tagged with an
  <em>admin_level</em>
  value between 1 (representing countries) and 10 (representing the smallest geographical units in each country). The numbers in between vary in meaning between countries or even between cities within a country. For example,
  <em>admin_level=6</em>
  may represent a province in some countries, a municipality in others, or an administrative ward in others. In each country, we have done our best to determine the most common meaning of each
  <em>admin_level</em>
  value and name them accordingly.&nbsp;</p>
  
  <p>If you believe your city is missing an important analysis area, please add it to OpenStreetMap (or ensure it is tagged with an appropriate
  <em>admin_level</em>
  value), and let us know. Also contact us if you think we have provided the wrong name for an
  <em>admin_level</em>
  value in your country. We welcome suggestions for improvement at
